# 🎓 Student Management System

## 📘 Overview
The **Student Management System** is a Python-based web application built with **Streamlit**, demonstrating the core principles of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**.  
It provides an intuitive interface to manage student records efficiently — allowing you to add, view, update, and delete student information with data persistence.

---

## ✨ Features
- ➕ Add, view, update, and delete student records  
- 💾 Store data automatically in a structured CSV file  
- ⚙️ Designed using OOP principles for modularity and scalability  
- 🎨 Streamlit-based UI with a clean dark theme  
- 🔐 Ensures simple yet secure data handling  

---

## 🧠 Object-Oriented Concepts Used
- **Classes & Objects** — for representing each student entity  
- **Encapsulation** — for managing internal data securely  
- **Abstraction** — simplifying data operations for users  
- **Polymorphism** — dynamic method functionality where required

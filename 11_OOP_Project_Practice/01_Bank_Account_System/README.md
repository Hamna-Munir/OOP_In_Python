# 💳 Bank Account Management System (Streamlit + Python OOP)

###   Developed by [**Hamna Munir**](https://github.com/Hamna-Munir)

---

## 📘 Overview

The **Bank Account Management System** is a Python-based interactive application built using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles and **Streamlit** for the user interface.

It simulates core banking operations like creating accounts, depositing funds, withdrawing money, and viewing account details — all within an elegant, browser-based interface.

This project demonstrates how OOP concepts can be effectively applied to real-world applications in an engaging and interactive way.
